#### Step 1: Select Algorithms

1. The simulation is divided into **5 steps**, each focusing on a specific category of algorithms.
2. Use the **"Next Step"** and **"Previous Step"** buttons to navigate between categories:
   - **Step 1:** Linear vs Logarithmic (Binary Search, Linear Search)
   - **Step 2:** Sorting Algorithms (Quick Sort, Bubble Sort)
   - **Step 3:** Matrix Operations (Matrix Addition, Matrix Multiplication)
   - **Step 4:** Exponential/Factorial (Subset Generation, Permutations)
   - **Step 5:** Custom – Compare any algorithms of your choice
3. Click the **"+ Algorithm Name"** buttons to add algorithms for comparison.

#### Step 2: Choose Maximum Input Size (N)

1. Select a value of **N** from the available radio buttons.
2. The available N values depend on the selected step to ensure reasonable execution times.

#### Step 3: Set Simulation Time (Optional)

1. Use the **"Max Simulation Time"** dropdown to limit how long each algorithm runs.
2. Default is 5 second. Increase for larger inputs if needed.

#### Step 4: Lock and Run

1. Check the **"Lock Values"** checkbox to finalize your selections.
2. Click **"Generate Inputs and Run Algorithm"** to start the simulation.
3. Wait for all algorithms to complete execution.

#### Step 5: Analyze Results

1. View the **execution time table** showing time (in ms) for each algorithm at different input sizes.
2. Observe the **graph** to visually compare how execution times grow with input size.
3. Read the **info text** below the graph for insights about the comparison.

**Understanding the Table:**
- Each cell shows the execution time in milliseconds for a specific algorithm and input size.
- **"Time/Memory Limit"** appears when:
  - The algorithm exceeds the maximum allowed input size (e.g., Bubble Sort is limited to N ≤ 5000 to prevent browser freeze).
  - The execution time exceeds the maximum simulation time you selected.
  - The algorithm requires too much memory for the given input size.
- This helps protect your browser from freezing on computationally expensive operations.

#### Step 6: Reset and Explore

1. Click **"Reset"** to clear selections and try a different comparison.
2. Navigate to other steps to explore more algorithm categories.
